# Ultimate script with schedule

As a fork/add-on to https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot â€” this bot uses multiple scripts that run on a schedule, continuously.
I also added multi account support with the pattern for text files as follows:

USERNAME_comments.txt
Eg:
github_comments.txt

This script uses [schedule](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) to do tasks. Just look at the code and change it - it should be clear enough.

To install _schedule_ module:
```
pip install schedule
```
